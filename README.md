Currency Converter along with rate updates

This currency Converter takes input of an integer value from user and the country from which the amount is originally from.
Then the user inputs the country which the conversion is taking place to and the amount is displayed with the converted currency value

The excahnge rates are stored in a file which is accessed by the program during conversion. The file location is the same as the program.

The user has to first login and the login has to validate in order to access the converter. This is done through GUI.
